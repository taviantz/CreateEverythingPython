#to get sarted with NumPy. I am installing the NumPy library.  
#which is typically done using the pip package manager. 
#this is the following command: pip install numpy

import numpy as np

#create a 5x5 Numpy array with random values
array = np.random.rand(5, 5)

#print the array 
print(array)

#compute the mean of the array 
mean = np.mean(array)

#print the mean
print(mean)

#To learn NumPy 
# 1. official NumPy documentation https://numpy.org/doc/stable 
# excellent resource for learning about the various feaures of NumPy and how to use them.
# documentation includes tutorials, guides, and API reference materials for all versions of NumPy,
# 2. NumPy tutorials on websites like DataCamp (https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-numpy).
# 3. these websites offer interactive tutorials that can help you learn NumPy step by step
# 4. Books: many books. Both for beginners and experienced data scientists 
# 5. Some of the best books include "Python for Data Analysis" by Wes McKinney or "NumPy Begginer's Guide" by Ivan Idris
# 6. There are many online forums and communities where I can ask questions and get help with my Numpy Code.
# some of the best forums and communities include reddit and stack Overflow
# these resources will teach me alot about NumPy and how to use it effectively for data analysis and scientific computing.
# the purpose of me doing this is explore and NumPy from different approaches. 

# Code explaination
# The Array:
# The array generated using np.random.rand(5, 5) contains random floating-point values.
# It's a 5x5 matrix (a 2D array).

# Mean Calculation:
# This code computes the mean (average) of all the values in this array.
# The mean is approximately 0.3619 (rounded to 4 decimal places).

# Interpretation:
# The mean represents the central tendency of the data.
# It's the average value across all the random numbers in the array.
# Remember that the np.random.rand() function generates random values between 0 and 1.
# So the array contains random values, and the mean gives an overall sense of their average magnitude.
