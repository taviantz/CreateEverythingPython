#Volume of a cube. A python lesson to calculate the volume of a cube. I am finding the volume of a cube.
# Using the the simple formula: Volume = (side length)***3
# My task is to simply apply the given formula Volume = (side length)***3 to find the volume of the cube and print it to the screen by writing a Python program.

side_length = 4
volume = side_length**3
print(volume)

#More in depth explaination of the code

# Measure the length of one side of the cube. 
side_length = 4

# Calculate the volume using the formula
volume = side_length**3

# Print the volume to the screen. In the first code I just printed the volume. In this code I added sentence "The volume of the cube is:", volume.
print("The volume of the cube is:", volume)
