# This Python program finds the last digit of a secret number

# Step 1: Assign the secret number to a variable
# In this example, we'll use 12345 as our secret number
secret_number = 12345

# Step 2: Use the modulus operator to find the last digit
# The modulus operator is the percent sign (%) calculates the remainder of a division operation
# When a number is divided by 10, the remainder is the last digit of that number
# This is because 10 is the base of our number system 

last_digit = secret_number % 10

# Step 3: Print the result
# This will display the last digit of the secret number 

print(last_digit)

# Finding a Python program of the last digit of a secret number

# Step 1: Assign the secret number to a variable
# In this example, we'll use 12345 as our secret number
x = 12345

# Step 2: Use the modulus operator to find the last digit and print it directly
# The modulus operator (%) calculates the remainder of a division operation
# When a number is divided by 10, the remainder is the last digit of that number
# This is because 10 is the base of our number system
