Hours and Minutes Conversion

Once Upon a Time in the Land of Python
In the vibrant and exciting world of Python, there lived a young coder named Jamie. One sunny day, Jamie stumbled upon a magical countdown on the event’s website for a grand programming competition. The countdown showed 856 minutes until the big event. Jamie, brimming with curiosity and excitement, wondered how to convert these minutes into hours and remaining minutes. This quest led Jamie on an adventure of learning and discovery.

The Magical Conversion Formula
Jamie’s wise mentor, a wizard named Dr. Sage, provided a crucial hint:

“There are 60 minutes in an hour. Use integer division and the modulo operator to convert minutes into hours and remaining minutes.”

Jamie scratched her head and asked,

“What’s integer division and modulo?”

The mentor explained:
- Integer Division (//): This operation divides one number by another and gives the whole number part of the quotient. It tells us how many full hours are there in the given minutes.
- Modulo Operator (%): This operation gives the remainder of the division. It tells us the leftover minutes after accounting for the whole hours.

Jamie’s Learning Adventure
With this wisdom, Jamie set off to solve the problem. Here’s how Jamie did it:

1. Understand the Conversion:
— There are 60 minutes in an hour.
— Use integer division to find out how many whole hours are in 856 minutes.
— Use the modulo operator to determine the remaining minutes.

2. Apply the Operations:
— Calculate hours using `total_minutes // 60`.
— Calculate remaining minutes using `total_minutes % 60`.

The Code in Action
Jamie wrote the following magical code to perform the conversion:

# Given minutes
total_minutes = 856

# Calculate hours and remaining minutes
hours = total_minutes // 60  # Integer division gives the whole hours
remaining_minutes = total_minutes % 60  # Modulo operator gives the remaining minutes

# Now, hours contains the number of complete hours, and remaining_minutes contains the leftover minutes

In another variation, Jamie saw that JetBrains provided a simple and elegant solution:

remaining_minutes = 856
hours = remaining_minutes // 60
minutes = remaining_minutes % 60
hours = int(hours)  # explicitly convert the number of hours to an integer
remaining_minutes = minutes

Jamie’s story continues with coding and learning while sharing the joy of discovery with everyone.
