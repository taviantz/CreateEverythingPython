#Any value you enter, the function sees as a string. 
#It doesn't matter if you enter digits or letters. 
#The input will be converted to a string.
#If you want a number to be a number, you should write it explicitly.

print("What's your favorite number?")
value = int(input())  # now value keeps an integer number
